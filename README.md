# WaveReader
Create audiobook albums from epub files using Googles WaveNet voices

# Warning
In its current form, this is nothing more than a proof-of-concept that I hacked together, to see if it's even possible. It is BTW :).
For now, if you can get it to work, it breaks the epub file into chapters, and creates neat little albums in opus format.

One of the last test-runs produced something like this:

```
Arifureta - Volume 3_01_Prologue.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_02_Chapter I An Adventurer's Job.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_03_Chapter II A New Meeting.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_04_Chapter III The Sack of Ur.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_05_Epilogue I.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_06_Epilogue II.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_07_Extra Chapter A Very Dramatic Before and After.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_08_Afterword.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_09_Bonus Short Stories.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_10_About J-Novel Club.opus
Arifureta - Volume 3_11_Copyright.opus
```

The files are not (yet) tagged, no cover art, no playlist, no nothing. Like I said, it barely works.
